# ðŸš€ Dockerized ML Model API with FastAPI

This project demonstrates how to train a machine learning model using scikit-learn, serve predictions via a FastAPI endpoint, and containerize the entire app using Docker. Itâ€™s a clean, minimal setup perfect for learning how to deploy ML models as APIs.

### This project contains 4 files: train_model.py , model.pkl , app.py , requirements.txt , DockerFile , README.md 
#### -> train_model.py
        -> Trains your ML model and saves it as a .pkl file
        -> Loads the Iris dataset using scikit-learn
        -> Trains a logistic regression model
        -> Serializes the model using pickle and saves it as model.pkl
#### -> model.pkl
        -> Stores your trained ML model in binary format
        -> This is the output of train_model.py
        -> Used by app.py to make predictions
        -> Should be kept in sync with your training logic
### -> app.py
        -> Serves your ML model as a REST API using FastAPI
        -> Loads model.pkl
        -> Defines a /PREDICT endpoint that accepts JSON input
        -> Returns predictions as JSON output
### -> requirements.txt
        -> Lists all Python dependencies needed for your project.
        -> fastapi for the web framework
        -> uvicorn as the ASGI server
        -> scikit-learn for ML training and inference
### -> DockerFile
        -> Defines how to build your Docker image.
        -> Starts from a base Python image
        -> Sets the working directory
        -> Copies your project files
        -> Installs dependencies
        -> Launches the FastAPI app with uvicorn
### -> README.md
        -> Explains what the project does
        -> Shows how to run it locally and test the API


## ðŸ§ª How to Run Locally

### 1. Train the model
```bash
python train_model.py
docker build -t ml-api .
docker run -p 5000:5000 ml-api
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri http://localhost:5000/predict `
  -Method POST `
  -ContentType "application/json" `
  -Body '{"features": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'
pip install -r requirements.txt
FROM python:3.10
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "5000"]
